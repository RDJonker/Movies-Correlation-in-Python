# Movies-Correlation-in-Python

In this project I used a dataset based on movies. I read the dataset into a dataframe and performed various data cleaning procedures. Then I used visualizations to try and identify any correlations between the variables. Then I assigned a numeric value to all the non-numeric columns and ran the correlation on the data again and identified the correlation between the variables.
